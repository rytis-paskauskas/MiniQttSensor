# MiniQttSensor: A Humidity and Temperature sensing IoT application

A fully functional IoT application for temperature and humidity sensing and data transfer over SSL-encrypted MQTT. Client certificate is not required.

Deploy it on several devices to collect data from multiple locations.

The app targets all ESP8266 and ESP32 boards. It has been tested with:
- Wemos WiFi-ESP8266 DevKit
- D1 Mini Pro Based on ESP8266EX
- ESP32 DevKit

Use your private or any public MQTT broker.

Includes an (optional) "accumulator" client, which polls all data into a MySQL database and bins older data from previously disconnected instances.


## Hardware requirements

- One or more ESP8266- or ESP32-based boards,
- One sht3x sensor per board and wires (four wires per sensor),
- Wifi connection (and access to Internet if using a LAN-external broker)
- 5V or 3.3V power source (5V, if applicable for a board, works better with WiFi).

This set-up is sufficient to build the app but additional items might be required depending on the deployment decisions:
- a rig for hosting the MQTT broker (Raspberry Pi, Cloud, ...)
- device(s) to read/display data (a smartphone, ...)

## Software prerequisited
This app has to be built using a board-specific  [Integrated Development Environment](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf "ESP IDF by Espressif"):
- [*ESP IDF*](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf "ESP-IDF on Github") for ESP32-based boards,
- [*ESP8266 RTOS SDK*](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK "ESP8266 RTOS SDK on Github") for ESP8266-based boards.

To build the (optional) polling client the following are required:
- Python
- MySQL or Mariadb. The client must have `CREATE, WRITE, READ, SELECT TABLES` permissions on at least one database. Depending on the hosting service, root access might be necessary.
- Systemd (optional) is used as a default deployment method but it is possible to run the client without it.

To deploy to a dedicated MQTT broker, one has to be able to setup and run a server. Public MQTT brokers exist ([such as this one](https://test.mosquitto.org "public MQTT broker")) that don't require neither special competences nor setting up.

To enjoy the outputs of this app, a MQTT client is required. The easiest is to use a MQTT client on a smartphone (there are several alternatives on the market).

## Install and build the project
### Get the IDE
This app has to be built using a board-specific IDE. 
The roadmap for the IDE installation is described [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step "install and setup ESP IDF"), for ESP32, and [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp8266-rtos-sdk/en/latest/get-started/index.html#setup-toolchain "install and setup ESP8266 RTOS SDK"), for ESP8266.
Follow the relevant instructions to
- Install prerequisites for Windows, Linux, or macOS;
- Get the relevant IDE (ESP IDF or ESP8266 RTOS SDK);
- Set up the toolchain;
- Set up the environment variables.

### Get the source code
Clone (or fork) this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rytis-paskauskas/MiniQttSensor
```

### Build and flash
Although the underlying build tools are different for the two IDEs, the workflows are almost identical and differ only in semantics (use of `make` vs. `idf.py`).
This projects can be built using the standard workflow; see [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#step-6-connect-your-device "ESP IDF build workflow") and [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp8266-rtos-sdk/en/latest/get-started/index.html#connect "ESP8266 RTOS SDK build workflow") for ESP32 and ESP8266 boards, respectively.

Things could potentially get messy in the case of building for both types of boards.
This project adopts several simple idiosynracies, described below, with the purpose of mitigating the issues.

The first issue is that the `sdkconfig` files are incompatible between the two SDKs. The two possible approaches are 
- start without a `sdkconfig` file and let the build tool generate a default one, or
- use one of the default templates `sdkconfig.esp8266default` or `sdkconfig.esp32default`, for example `cp sdkconfig.esp8266default sdkconfig; make menuconfig`.

For the same reason, the project is configured to use a non-standard build directory,  `build_esp8266` for ESP8266, and `build` (not `build_esp32`, because I can't get it to work cleanly with CMake) for ESP32.

See also `Makefile` and the `CMakeLists.txt` for respective control statements.

## Clients

The payload is formatted as a JSON string
```text
{measurement:{temperature: xx.xx,humidity: yy.yy}}
```
(and is exactly 57 bytes long).

### Deploying the included client
TBD.

### Other clients

#### Mosquitto 
[Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org) has a desktop client application that is quite convenient.

Assuming that a broker has been setup on `localhost`, and its public certificate copied to `ca_certificates/broker.crt`, subscribe to all devices in verbose mode  (useful for debugging) like so:
```sh
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 8883 --cafile ca_certificates/broker.crt  -t 'sense/sht3x/#' -F %J  --pretty -v
```

## FAQ
- Why this sensor? What is the accuracy of measurement?
  See [this thread](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/compare-different-i2c-temperature-and-humidity-sensors-sht2x-sht3x-sht85/599609 "i2c sensor Arduino forum thread") for inspiration and/or possible alternatives. Don't expect too much in terms of accuracy (my rule of thumb: ±1°C, ±10% RH).
